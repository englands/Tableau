This repository contains the certificates I earned from the Tableau Fundamentals Skills Track, which includes the following courses:

- Introduction to Tableau
- Analyzing Data in Tableau
- Creating Dashboards in Tableau
- Connecting Data in Tableau

### Introduction to Tableau
In this course, I learned how to navigate Tableau's interface, connect, and present data with easily understandable visualizations. I grasped fundamental concepts, and features, and created various visualizations.

### Analyzing Data in Tableau
In this course, I learned about the principles of data visualization, and how to make dashboards interactive and appealing. I used Calculated Fields, created bins, customized filters and interactions, and applied quick table calculations and power user techniques.    

### Creating Dashboards in Tableau
In this course, I learned best practices for creating dashboards, and how to make dashboards interactive. I added explanatory elements, modified dashboard layouts for mobile devices, and downloaded images as PDFs.

### Connecting Data in Tableau
In the final course of the Skills Track, I created connections to CSV and Excel files. I learned about connectors, and how to combine multiple tables with joins, unions, and relationships. I also learned about different data properties like renaming data fields, creating aliases, changing data types, and changing default properties for a data field.
