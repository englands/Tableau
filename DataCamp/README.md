I learned more about Tableau in preparation for the Desktop Specialist Exam. I used DataCamp to fill in knowledge gaps from the Tableau Data Science Certificate program offered by the University of South Florida. I am using the Tableau Fundamentals Track from DataCamp as well as the other Tableau Track to help prepare for the test and to provide more practice with the software.
