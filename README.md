# Tableau Repository <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/tableau-software" align=right>

This repository demonstrates my learning journey with [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), one of the world's leading business intelligence platforms. I first learned of Tableau during my undergraduate years at the University of South Florida (Go Bulls! ðŸ¤˜). I was immersed in Tableau through the Citizen Data Science Program, where I used Tableau in many of my classes at the Muma College of Business.

I am a certified [Tableau Desktop Specialist Exam](https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification/desktop-specialist), where I used DataCamp, SkillCertPro, and Udemy to fill any knowledge gaps from my initial Citizen Data Science Certificate program and to ensure that I am confident in my Tableau abilities before the exam. I also have separate Tableau projects that I have completed from various sources, including Coursera.
