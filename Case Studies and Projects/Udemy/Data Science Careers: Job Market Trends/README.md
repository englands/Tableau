# Data Science Careers: Job Market Trends ðŸ“Š

The dataset used for this project consists of a single .csv sheet and over 600 rows of data consisting of the experience level needed, the work year, the job title, the salary, the currency of the salary, the salary in US dollars, the country where the employee would be based, the percentage of the job being remote, the employee residence, and the company size.
