# Credit Card Complaints: Customer Feedback Analysis ðŸ“Š

The dataset consists of a single Excel sheet comprising nearly 87,000 records of credit card complaints from various credit card companies. The dataset includes the company name, the company's response to the consumer, the complaint category, ID of the complaint, if the consumer consented, and if the consumer disputed. The date of the complaint being received, the date the complaint was sent to the company, the dimension, the issue, the product, the state, mode of submittal, tags, and if the response was timely.
