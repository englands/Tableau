# Video Games Sales: Gaming Market Analysis ðŸ“Š

In this dataset, I had a single text file (.csv) with various data types, including the game's publisher, the platform of the video game, the regional sales for North America, the European Union, Japan, and other global sales. Additional game information includes the name, sales rank compared to other gaming systems, and the game's genre. 

Visualizations created for this project include:

- Area Chart of Sales by Year and Genre
- Bar Chart with Top 10 Games by Sales
- Treemap of Top 10 Platforms by Sales
- Bubble Chart visualizing Top 10 Publishers by Sales
- Text KPIs highlighting the total names, platforms, and publishers in the dataset
