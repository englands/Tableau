# AirBnBs in Seattle: Retail Market Analysis ðŸ“Š

In this project, I used a dataset that had three .csv files that contained various information related to the listing, including the listing information, review information, and price per night. The data includes thousands of listings with thousands of reviews and is scraped from January 4, 2016, through January 2, 2017.

The visualizations created include:
- Bar chart displaying the number of bedrooms versus prices
- Table sorting number of listings based on the number of bedrooms
- Map highlighting the average listing price based on neighborhood
- Bar chart displaying price by zip code
- Line graph demonstrating revenue over the year
