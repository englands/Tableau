# Superstore Sales: Retail Analysis ðŸ“Š

This project observed orders for a superstore. The project combined three sheets within the Tableau software in the .xls file: one for orders, returns, and users, with over 8,300 orders taken between January 2009 and December 2012. The information for each order includes the order ID, order date, priority, quantity, sales, discount,  profit, product category, product subcategory, product name, product container, product base margin, shipping date, shipping mode, and shipping cost. For the customer information, the data includes the customer's name, province, region, and customer segment.

The following visualizations were created for the project:
- KPIs (listing the average discount, total order quantity, total profit, and total sales)
- Bar Graph visualizing the Sales by Category
- Donut Chart visualizing the total profit and total profit by customer segment
- Area Graph visualizing the daily sales between April and May 2012
- Table listing the Top 10 Customers by total sales
