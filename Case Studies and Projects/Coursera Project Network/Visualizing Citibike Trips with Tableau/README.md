# Visualizing Citibike Trips in Tableau 📊

In this project, I used Tableau Desktop to import the Citibike data, New York City's public bicycle-sharing system. The data contained all trips taken in February 2018 and includes thousands of trips.

The visualizations created include
- Plotting the most popular end stations and start stations
- Determining the average trip duration for customers and subscribers
- Graphing the top 5 stations based on trip count
- Determining the most popular start times and end times
