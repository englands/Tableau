# Analyzing Customer Churn in TableauðŸ“Š

In this project, I used Tableau Desktop to import the data for Databel, a fictional telecommunications company and analyzed various aspects of their data including demographics, churn rate, their payment methods, and contract type.

The visualizations created include
- Determining overall churn rate, churn categories, and churn reasons
- Explored demographics of customers including age and usage of international data
- Observed the data plan and contract type
- Four dashboards highlighting trends
- A story encapsulating the most pressing insights
