# Citizen Data Science Certificate
The [Tableau Citizen Data Science Certificate)](https://www.usf.edu/business/centers/analytics-creativity/tableau-citizen-data-science-certificate.aspx) is for any Muma College of Business student at the University of South Florida. To complete the certification requirements, students must create Tableau workbooks as well as present that information.

The following were the classes that I created Tableau Visualizations to complete the certificate program:
-   
- [GEB 4890](https://cloud.usf.edu/academic-programs/details/prefix/GEB/code/4890): Strategic  Management / Executive Decision Making (Capstone Course)


Each folder contains the data source and the subsequent Tableau workbook with the visualizations.
