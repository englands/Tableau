The [Tableau Citizen Data Science Certificate](https://www.usf.edu/business/centers/analytics-creativity/tableau-citizen-data-science-certificate.aspx) is for any Muma College of Business student at the University of South Florida. To complete the certification requirements, students must create Tableau workbooks as well as present that information. As a recent graduate of the University of South Florida, I received this certificate upon completion of the final capstone course ðŸŽ“.
